# Convert a Java Web Application to Launch with Jetty Runner

## Prerequisites

* Basic Java knowledge, including an installed version of the JVM and Maven.
* Basic Git knowledge, including an installed version of Git.
* A Java web application. If you don't have one follow the first step to create an example. Otherwise skip that step.

### What is Jetty and Jetty Runner?
Jetty is a lightweight Java application server that offers a flexible array of options for how it can be launched. One popular option is using embedded Jetty the way that the [java quickstart](http://devcenter.heroku.com/java) does. Another good option is the Jetty Runner jar file. Each version of Jetty that is released includes a Jetty Runner jar. This jar can be run directly from the java command and can be passed a war file to load right on the command line. An example of this would be:

    :::term
    $ java -jar jetty-runner.jar application.war

Jetty Runner will then launch a Jetty instance with the given war deployed to it.

## Create an application if you don't already have one

    :::term
    $ mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp
    ...
    [INFO] Generating project in Interactive mode
    Define value for property 'groupId': : com.example
    Define value for property 'artifactId': : helloworld
    
(you can pick any groupId or artifactId). You now have a complete Java web app in the `helloworld` directory.

## Configure Maven to Download Jetty Runner

Although not necessary for using Jetty Runner it's a good idea to have your build tool download Jetty Runner for you since your application will need it to run. You could, of course, just download Jetty Runner and use it to launch your application without doing this. However having all of your dependencies defined in your build descriptor is important for application portability and repeatability of deployment. In this case we're using Maven so we'll use the dependency plugin to download the jar. Add the following plugin configuration to your pom.xml:

    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.3</version>
        <executions>
            <execution>
                <phase>package</phase>
                <goals><goal>copy</goal></goals>
                <configuration>
                    <artifactItems>
                        <artifactItem>
                            <groupId>org.mortbay.jetty</groupId>
                            <artifactId>jetty-runner</artifactId>
                            <version>7.5.4.v20111024</version>
                            <destFileName>jetty-runner.jar</destFileName>
                        </artifactItem>
                    </artifactItems>
                </configuration>
            </execution>
        </executions>
    </plugin>

## Start with a pre-built app that uses Jetty Runner

If you want to skip project setup  steps and start with an app that already uses Jetty Runner you can clone the finished sample and then skip to the 'Deploy Your Application to Heroku' section:

    :::term
    $ git clone git@github.com:heroku/devcenter-jetty-runner.git

 
## Run your Application

To generate the start scripts simply run:

    :::term
    $ mvn package

And then run your app using the java command:

    :::term
    $ java -jar target/dependency/jetty-runner.jar target/*.war

That's it. Your application should start up on port 8080 and is now more portable and erosion resistant!

# Deploy your Application to Heroku

## Create a Procfile

You declare how you want your application executed in `Procfile` in the project root. Create this file with a single line:

    :::term
    web:    java $JAVA_OPTS -jar target/dependency/jetty-runner.jar --port $PORT target/*.war

## Deploy to Heroku

Commit your changes to Git:

    :::term
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Ready to deploy"

Create the app on the Cedar stack:

    :::term
    $ heroku create --stack cedar
    Creating high-lightning-129... done, stack is cedar
    http://high-lightning-129.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:high-lightning-129.git
    Git remote heroku added

Congratulations! Your web app should now be up and running on Heroku. Open it in your browser with:

    :::term  
    $ heroku open
